# Argent Bank Banking App Authentication System

This repository contains the code of the authentication system of the Argent Bank application.

## 1. How to install the application

## 1.1 Prerequisites

#### 1.1.A Tools

- [Node.js (version 16.15.1)](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [npm (version 8.11.0)](https://www.npmjs.com/)

#### 1.1.B API

This project uses APIs to authenticate a user. Once you have finished installing it by following the instructions of the [README file in the backend repository,](https://github.com/YannickLefaivre/Project-10-Bank-API) you can proceed to installing the front end.

I recommend that you create a folder on your computer that will contain the back and front code:

```
- argent-bank
    - back
    - front
```

> Note: it says that the API requires a certain version of NodeJS, be aware that you can use a different version for the user interface without causing a problem of compatibility with the API.

### 1.2 Launch the project

- Clone it on your computer,
- The command `npm install` will allow you to install the project dependencies,
- The command `npm run start` will allow you to run the user interface.

## 2. Consult the documentation

Documentation of the code can be found in the docs folder. By opening the [project github page](https://yannicklefaivre.github.io/YannickLefaive_13_07072022/), you will have access to this file _(README.md)_ as well as to the documentation of the classes, functions and methods of this project.
